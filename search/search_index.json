A strategic mix of the methods proposed here may yield superior results, inviting you to experiment and discover the approach that best suits your needs.</p> <p>Please note that some of these techniques are currently exclusively applicable to our most advanced model, GPT-4. If you are yet to access GPT-4, consider signing up for the waiting list. When you notice a GPT model struggling with a task, and a superior model is accessible, reattempting with the more capable model is usually beneficial.</p>"},{"location":"#six-strategic-approaches-for-enhanced-results","title":"Six Strategic Approaches for Enhanced Results","text":""},{"location":"#1-formulate-precise-instructions","title":"1. Formulate Precise Instructions","text":"<p>GPT-4 isn't telepathic; precise instructions yield precise results. Be explicit about the complexity, length, and format of the output you desire. The more clearly you communicate your needs, the more likely you'll receive an optimal response.</p> <p>Tactical Suggestions:</p> <ul> <li>Include comprehensive details in your query to ensure relevant responses.</li> <li>Encourage the model to assume a specific persona.</li> <li>Utilize delimiters to clearly segregate different parts of the input.</li> <li>Enumerate the steps needed to complete a task.</li> <li>Provide relevant examples.</li> <li>Specify the desired length of the output.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#2-offer-reference-text","title":"2.
